**About the Video**
<p align="justify">
    In this brief talk at the "Green Academy 2020" organized by Heinrich Böll Stiftung South Caucasus I discuss the impact of the pandemic on urban life and the inequalities exposed by it in cities.
    Urban density can indeed contribute to a faster spread of the infection, but at the same time can mitigate the negative impacts brought by the pandemic, as physical proximity to essential services or recreation have been proved to be extermely important for the well-being of the urban residents.
