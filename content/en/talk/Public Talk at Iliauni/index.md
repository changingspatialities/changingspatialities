**About the Talk**
<p align="justify">
    In the frameworks of research seminar <a href="https://urbanassemblage.iliauni.edu.ge/">series</a> organized by the Department of Anthropology at Ilia State University,  I had the privilege to talk about my <a href="https://gkankia.xyz/publication/mobility-infrastructure-and-idps/">research</a>. 

<p align="justify">
    The research uncovered the everyday mobility behaviour trends of IDPs from Abkhazia residing in one of the outskirts of Tbilisi. The research findings show how much their urban livelihoods and social connections are affected by the lack of accessibility to mobility infrastructures and its bits and pieces creating a larger assemblage of infrastructures and urban segregation.
