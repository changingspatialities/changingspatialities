  Urban planning and geography graduate with over 7 years of practical experience. </p> 
<p align="justify">
  I have worked on numerous spatial planning and research projects, applying both quantitative and qualitative methods. While most of the my work is located in the Georgian socio-spatial context, from my previous studies and fellowships I have gained valuable insights into the urban and regional development patterns in Europe, USA and Latin America. I have consulted for international organizations, including <b>The World Bank </b> and the <b> Asian Development Bank</b>.</p>
<p align="justify"> 
  My researh interests range from the exploration of the fluidities of urban space and human bodies, the socio-material nature of the built environment and the everyday practices of urban living, to planning practices and urban policy-making. I believe in dense, human-scale and walkable communities.</p> 
<p align="justify">
  In my previous work I have focused on urban analytics, such as accessibility and sustainable mobility, land-use change, real estate analysis and segregation. I have conducted several workshops on open-source and participatory mapping, data analysis and visualization using GIS, Python and other spatial modelling and visualization tools.</p> 
<p align="justify">
  To encapsulate all of the above, I have co-founded and co-run a data visualization and analysis project <a href="https://zaxis.ge/">Z.axis</a> with my fellows. The project aims to bring data visualization and analytics tools closer to the general public and explain more thoroughly some of the pressing social issues happening on a daily basis.</p>
<p align="justify"> 
  I try to make or better, learn how to make pretty-looking maps and visuals in my spare time. I am always open for an interesting and challenging collaboration, both through the <a href="mailto:giorgi@zaxis.ge">organization</a> and individually.</p>
