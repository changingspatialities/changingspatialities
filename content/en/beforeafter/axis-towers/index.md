Kipshidze street area has become another iconic site depicting the patterns of the wild urbanisation processes that has turned Tbilisi into a concrete jungle over the last couple of decades. Under the "high and world class city" ideals, open, public spaces have been gradually smoothed over to produce elite urban spaces with residential, office or commercial uses, and to which mostly the privileged will have full access.
From the small open area in 2005, currently at the latest stages of development by an $ 83 mln [investment](http://axistowers.ge/en/about-developer/) project, only a small portion of the public space remained, as shown on the image taken in 2015.
