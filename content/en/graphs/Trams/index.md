### TBILISI TRAM NETWORK IN EARLY 1960s

Starting from the early 1950s, soviet mass housing projects, concentrated in so called “mikrorayons” in the outskirts of the city, were connected to major industrial zones primarily by public transit, as access to private vehicle to general population was limited. 

**Tools Used:** _Arcmap_; _QGIS_; _Adobe Illustrator_ **Data:** _Wikipedia_

### NETWORKED INFRASTRUCTURE IN CONTEMPORARY TBILISI

Urban network infrastructures in Tbilisi, such as electricity, water, gas or communication are splintered (Graham, 2001) and conform to market-based approach of service provision. They are owned, maintained and delivered to citizens by private/semi-private companies.

**Tools Used:** _Arcmap_;  **Data:** _Tbilisi City Municipality_
