Recent years has been gradually seeing positive changes in approaches towards urban mobility planning from the side of city authorities. Even though much of the systemic change remains to be seen in the future, it is important to underline that the process seems to be well underway. City officials now publicly <a href="http://tbilisi.gov.ge/news/10349?fbclid=IwAR31FMepurTS7XZfEus5nLZ9b83BKYP64fi_kB5RU_UbqIggRXc-QbYkQHA">ackowledge</a> the high priority of sustainable urban mobility planning. The redesign process of city's major mobility arteries serve as an example of such change.
Bicycle is an integral part of the sustainble urban mobility and gets high priority in modern planning policies and practices throughout the world to tackle the challenges posed by climate change or increased air pollution and traffic congestion in large metropolises.
One of the key arguments to explain why the bicycle is heavily underrated and undermined as an alternative to other mobility forms in Tbilisi is the hilly terrain of the city. Indeed, Tbilisi has a decent amount of streets where due to the steepness it is virtually impossible for any phisically-fit person to cycle-up, however, does that make it completely uncyclable? May be not!
The map below intends to debunk that myth about Tbilisi and highlights in green shading (slopes up to 6%) the streets, where it would be perfectly possible for an average bicycle user to move, whereas red shading shows streets where it would be a difficult task to cycle.
